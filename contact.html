        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the project is to promote the safety of our people and also eliminate or give less chances to human trafficking, murder and abduction,it is quite evident that people die or go missing almost everyday in our country and with such deeds coming to our attention we took it upon ourselves to create an Siza-Mna(help me) emergency app  to able to track people and also keep the victim's loved one alert about their whereabouts when they are in danger


            The main aim is to accomplish creating an app that will help victims to be reached when in any kind of the above mentioned problems and this app will make it easier for them to be tracked or located it is quite saddening to see people mourning their loved one or even not knowing where they are hence we saw it fit to create this app as an act of eliminating the pandemic of murder abuduction and kidnapping
            
            
            This project has numerous benefits one of them being the safety of our fellow citizens and the elimination or jeopidising the syndicates of human trafficking
            
            
            This project should be done to ensure the safety and comfortability of our people and also to show the prepetrators that they do not stand a chance.
            
            The expected consequences of this project might be cost wise as it may be very costing to implement it and make it function due to the resources needed.
